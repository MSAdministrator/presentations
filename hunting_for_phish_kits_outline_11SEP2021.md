# Hunting for Phish Kits

## Abstract

We're all defending our organizations from phishing attacks. We've invested in the latest spam filters, awareness training, and response capabilities but it will only help us from current (e.g. known) threats. We are constantly trying to catch up. Instead of waiting for the next email we need to take further actions. We need to fight back.

## Synopsis

As security practioners we have to defend ourselves and anyone under our perview or anyone from our organizations from phishing attacks.
We have invested alot of money in spam filters, awareness training (especially enabling users to report malicious messages), and responding to phishing messages.
We need to continue to do so, and it has helped (to some extent), but this attack vector continues to grow and advance; these defensive tools will only defend against the current threats.
This leaves us in a situation where are always catching up.
Instead of waiting for the next event we need to go to the enemy. We need to fight back.

## Outline

* "Have you ever seen someone who has obvisouly never been fishing? You can tell because of all the fancy gear they have on. That's what we look like."
* "If you know the the best places to fish in a lake, do you share that with your friends? If not, you should. You can't expect to be on the lake all the time."
* "Imagine you go to a lake to fish and all you do is release them back into the water. Then a friend goes to the same lake and does the same thing. And another friend does the same. Do you think that fish will learn to not bite next time?"
* "Imagine we all go to a lake on different days to fish for that one 'mystical' 10 pound bass. We all try to catch it but we all ultimately loose. If we would have coordinated we may have caught it but instead we wanted to keep it all to ourselves. By sharing at least one of us will get it which is better than no one getting it."

    * Why to Listen to Me (Authority)
    * What I'm going to tell you
        * Explain the current (best) practices for responding to phishing attacks
        * Why current tools/methodologies will (has) ultimately failed us
        * What we need to do is fight back and share

* Imagine we all have our own ponds and we are all trying to eradicate Carp from them. You go and buy the best gear in the world to catch the fish but you release them in someone elses pond. We are all trying to protect our own ponds (and we should!) but by releasing these Carp we are making it someone elses problem; and someone else is doing the same thing to you. Instead, we should talk and share information. During these conversations we realize that Tom (fuck tom) was putting Carp in our ponds the whole time. We should kick Tom's ass for fucking with us.
        * Our Ponds are similar
        * Fishing Gear
        * Catch. Release. Repeat.
        * Wateringhole
        * Fuck Tom. Kick his ass.
    * * Imagine we all have our own ponds and we are all trying to eradicate Carp from them. You go and buy the best gear in the world to catch and relocate the fish. We are all trying to protect our own ponds (and we should!) but they keep showing up. We are all having the same problem but we don't know it. We all start talking and sharing information and realize that Greg (fuck Greg) was putting Carp in our ponds the whole time. We should kick Greg's ass for fucking with us.

* Draft Body
    * Imagine we all live in an apartment complex. Lately there have been a string of thefts in the building. We each call the police individually and explain that someone broke into our apartment, hit us over the head and stole some items. The police recommend that we should install better locks, take some self defense training and secure our items. The next person gets robbed and the cycle repeats. The attacker has the same M.O.; break-in, hit us over the head and steal valuable items but the police explain that this is just what happens and it's your responsibility to protect yourself. What's your reaction?
* Body
    * We all have our own apartment
    * We've all been hit
    * Protect & Serve
    * We're on our own
        * Understanding kits
        * Understanding why it's important
    * Lets band together
* Conclusion
    * Key takeaways
        * If you're not doing the latest methodologies then start there
        * Just because you can't catch the fish, doesn't mean we shouldn't support them
